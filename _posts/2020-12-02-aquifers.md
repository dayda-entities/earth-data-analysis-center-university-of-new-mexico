This map layer contains the shallowest principal aquifers of the conterminous
                United States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, portrayed as
                polygons. The map layer was developed as part of the effort to produce the maps
                published at 1:2,500,000 in the printed series "Ground Water Atlas of the United
                States". The published maps contain base and cultural features not included in these
                data. This is a replacement for the July 1998 map layer called Principal Aquifers of
                the 48 Conterminous United States.
