This data set contains a 1:100,000 scale vector digital representation of all interstate highways, all US highways, most of the state highways, and some county roads in New Mexico. The data were collected using Trimble Pathfinder Basic Plus GPS units and differentially corrected with Trimble Pfinder software, version 2.40-07. They were converted to ARC/INFO format using ARC/INFO 7.0.3. The file size is approximately 4.2 Mb, compressed.
