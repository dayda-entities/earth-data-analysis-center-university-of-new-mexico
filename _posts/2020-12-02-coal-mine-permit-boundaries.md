ESRI ArcView shapefile depicting New Mexico coal mines permitted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), by either the NM Mining & Minerals Division (MMD), or by the federal DOI Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation & Enforcement, as of October 2005. The permit boundaries of the mines are displayed as polygons; these boundaries were typically derived from source AutoCAD drawing (.dwg) files submitted to as part of the permitting process, and are known to contain some inaccuracies.
