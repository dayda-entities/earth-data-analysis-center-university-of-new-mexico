 Hospitals in New Mexico The term "hospital" ... means an institution which-
                (1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to
                inpatients > (A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical
                diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or > (B)
                rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick
                persons; (...) (5) provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a
                registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered
                professional nurse on duty at all times; ... (...) (7) in the case of an institution
                in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of
                hospitals, > (A) is licensed pursuant to such law or > (B) is approved, by the
                agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the
                standards established for such licensing; (Excerpt from Title XVIII of the Social
                Security Act [42 U.S.C. ยง 1395x(e)],
                http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001395---x000-.html)
                Included in this dataset are General Medical and Surgical Hospitals, Psychiatric and
                Substance Abuse Hospitals, and Specialty Hospitals (e.g., Children's Hospitals,
                Cancer Hospitals, Maternity Hospitals, Rehabilitation Hospitals, etc.). TGS has made
                a concerted effort to include all general medical/surgical hospitals in New Mexico.
                Other types of hospitals are included if they were represented in datasets sent by
                the state. Therefore, not all of the specialty hospitals in New Mexico are
                represented in this dataset. Hospitals operated by the Veterans Administration (VA)
                are included, even if the state they are located in does not license VA Hospitals.
                Nursing homes and Urgent Care facilities are excluded because they are included in a
                separate dataset. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded from
                the dataset. Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located
                on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data
                Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. Text
                fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent
                database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the
                Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to
                facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The
                currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based upon this
                field, the oldest record dates from 06/16/2008 and the newest record dates from
                06/27/2008
