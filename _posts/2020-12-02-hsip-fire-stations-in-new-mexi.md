 Fire Stations in New Mexico Any location where fire fighters are stationed or
                based out of, or where equipment that such personnel use in carrying out their jobs
                is stored for ready use. Fire Departments not having a permanent location are
                included, in which case their location has been depicted at the city/town hall or at
                the center of their service area if a city/town hall does not exist. This dataset
                includes those locations primarily engaged in forest or grasslands fire fighting,
                including fire lookout towers if the towers are in current use for fire protection
                purposes. This dataset includes both private and governmental entities. Fire
                fighting training academies are also included. This dataset is comprised completely
                of license free data. The Fire Station dataset and the EMS dataset were merged into
                one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery
                purposes. Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on
                a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure
                (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. Text fields in this
                dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine
                search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have
                been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with
                database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is
                indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based upon this field, the oldest record dates
                from 01/31/2005 and the newest record dates from 07/17/2008.
