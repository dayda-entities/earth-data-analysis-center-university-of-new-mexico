This is a polygon feature data layer of United States National Grid (1000m x
				1000m polygons ) constructed by the Center for Interdisciplinary Geospatial
				Information Technologies at Delta State University with support from the US
				Geological Survey under the Cooperative Agreement 07ERAG0083. For correct display,
				please set the base coordinate system and projection such that it matches the UTM
				zone for which these data were constructed using the NAD 83 datum. Further
				information about the US National Grid is available from http://www.fgdc.gov/usng
				and a viewing of these layers as applied to local geography may be seen at the
				National Map, http://www.nationalmap.gov. The name of each dataset has the following
				format - StateAbbv_USNG_UTMXX. For example, for the UTM zone 15 of Mississippi, the
				dataset is named MS_USNG_UTM15.
