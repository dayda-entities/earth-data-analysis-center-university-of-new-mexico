This dataset is meant to depict Wilderness Study Areas (WSA's), within the state of New Mexico, identified by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as having potential for wilderness designation.  Each study areas has been valuated for its resource values, present and projected future uses, public input, the manageability of the area as wilderness, the environmental consequences of designating (or not) the area as wilderness, and mineral surveys.
Data was collected by the BLM - New Mexico State Office.
