The exported ESRI point shapefile 'allwells' was made using Arc Map 8.2 on a Win2000 pc The points were created from a download of the informix data base in June, 2002. Source of the location of the points varies. All State Plane Coordinates were entered by the applicant as the location of his well, usually from looking at a 1:24k USGS topographical map. A UTM coordinate is calculated to the center of the third quarter, or the smallest quarter of a section of land within the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). These quarters were also identified by the applicant as the location of the well. If no quarter was given, the UTM coordinate is calculated to the center of the section. The Bureau of Land Management's GCDB *.lx files were used to plot the wells in the database that are entered by section, quarter, quarter, quarter description. Points that were originally located in the State Plane Coordinate system were projected using ArcInfo to UTM Zone 13, NAD83. The final
				data set is projected in UTM Zone 13, NAD83. Attributes found with this coverage are downloaded from the OSE WATERS database with the exception of X-coord, y-coord which were calculated. Accuracy of well informatioin will be greatly enhanced when the entire state has been abstracted.
