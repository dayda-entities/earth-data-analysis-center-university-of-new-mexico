 The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) data incorporates all Digital Flood
                Insurance Rate Map(DFIRM) databases published by FEMA, and any Letters Of Map
                Revision (LOMRs) that have been issued against those databases since their
                publication date. The DFIRM Database is the digital, geospatial version of the flood
                hazard information shown on the published paper Flood Insurance Rate Maps(FIRMs).
                The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event,
                the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The NFHL
                data are derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood
                Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs
                and FIRMs, and new mapping data where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by
                the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the
                horizontal control of DFIRM data are consistent with those required for mapping at a
                scale of 1:12,000. The NFHL data contain layers in the Standard DFIRM datasets
                except for S_Label_Pt and S_Label_Ld. The NFHL is available as State or US Territory
                data sets. Each State or Territory data set consists of all DFIRMs and corresponding
                LOMRs available on the publication date of the data set.
