 This data set consists of photo centers of raw aerial images representing
				multi-spectral (red, green, blue, near-infrared) digital aerial imagery of the Las
				Conchas Fire that burned in the Santa Fe National Forest in the Jemez Mountains of
				central New Mexico in the summer of 2011. The Area of Interest (AOI) is 632,000
				acres and is larger than the actual burn acreage of approximately 150,000 acres that
				lies within the AOI. Aerial imagery was collected with a frame - based Z/I Digital
				Mapping Camera at an average elevation of 4,500 feet above ground; generating an
				average ground sample distance (gsd) of 0.45 feet. The aerial imagery will be used
				to create natural color and false color infrared digital orthophotos of the AOI at a
				re-sampled gsd of 0.5 foot. The imagery will support the Forest Service Burned Area
				Emergency Response (BAER) program that addresses landscape damage due to the fire,
				with the goal of protecting life, property, water quality, and deteriorated
				ecosystems from further damage now that the fire is out. Airborne GPS procedures
				were used to determine the camera station coordinates of each exposure. The nearest
				CORS base station was used to post process these coordinates with Applanix software
				into the project datum of NAD83/NAVD 88, UTM Zone 13, meters.
