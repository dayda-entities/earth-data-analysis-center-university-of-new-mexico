 This data has been collected by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in New Mexico at
both the New Mexico State Office and the various field offices. Collection began in the 1980's using
the BLM's ADS software to digitize data m the original case files. In the mid to late 1990's the
data was converted from ADS to ArcInfo software. Collection continued into the 1990s and has been
updated regularly until June 2000 when it was merged into a statewide coverage. In this edition, all
updates were made in the area managed by the Carlsbad Field Office. Allotments not included in the
first edition were added using on-screen digitizing from case file maps at various scales.
Corrections were also made to many allotment boundaries where overlaps and gaps had previously been
shown. Note for Shapefiles: Shapefiles have been created from coverages using the "Export Coverage
to Shapefile" function in ArcGIS 8.3. All occurrences of "#" and "-" in INFO item names are replaced
with an underscore character. This includes COVER# and COVER-ID, which become "COVER_" and
"COVER_ID". Additionally, the Shapefile format only allows 10 characters in item names, so long item
names are truncated. To avoid duplicate names, the items are truncated and assigned consecutive
numbers. For example, in a coverage called CITY_STREET the items "CITY_STREET#" and "CITY_STREET-ID"
become "CITY_STRE" and "CITY_STR_1" .
