This map layer portrays the linear federally-owned land features (i.e., national parkways, wild and scenic rivers, etc.) of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The map layer was created by extracting linear federal land features from the 1:2,000,000-scale individual State DLG files produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. These files were then merged into a single map layer. This is a revised version of the July 2001 map layer.
