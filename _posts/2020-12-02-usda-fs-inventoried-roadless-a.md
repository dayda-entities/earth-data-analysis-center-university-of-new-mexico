This dataset contains all National Forest Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs)
                for New Mexico. The IRA data was originally submitted to GSTC by all national
                forests through their Regional Offices for the Forest Service's Roadless Area
                Conservation Initiative. Unknown The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used in
                the Draft Environment Impact Statement. Between the draft and final stages of the
                Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any
                corrections to Inventoried Roadless Areas that were based on their existing forest
                plan. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information
                and to include Inventoried Roadless Areas within Special Designated Areas. The data
                was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed
                coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact
                Statement. Unknown IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in
                revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be
                available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are
                completed and adopted by the agency. RARE II information was used in cases where a
                forest does not have a more current roadless inventory, which was established using
                RARE II information.
