This file contains a feature class depicting National Forest System land parcels that have a
                Congressionally designated boundary. Examples include National Wilderness Area,
                Primitive Area, or Wilderness Study Area. This dataset is derived from the USFS
                Southwestern Region ALP (Automated Lands Program) data Project. This is one of six
                layers derived from ALP for the purpose of supplying data layers for recourse GIS
                analysis and data needs within the Forest Service. The six layers are Surface
                Ownership, Administrative Forest Boundary, District Boundary, Townships, Sections,
                and Wilderness. There were some gaps in the ALP data so a small portion of this
                dataset comes from CCF (Cartographic Feature Files) datasets and the USFS
                Southwestern Region Core Data Project. ALP data are developed from data sources of
                differing accuracy, scales, and reliability. Where available they are developed from
                GCDB (Geographic Coordinate Data Base) data. GCDB data are maintained by the Bureau
                of Land Management in their State Offices. GCDB data are mostly corner data. Not all
                corners and not all boundaries are available in GCDB so ALP also utilizes many other
                data sources like CFF data to derive its boundaries. GCDB data are in a constant
                state of change because land corners are always being resurveyed. The GCDB data
                used in this dataset represents a snapshot in time when the GCDB dataset was
                published by the BLM and may not reflect the most current GCDB dataset available.
                The Forest Service makes no expressed or implied warranty with respect to the
                character, function, or capabilities of these data. These data are intended to be
                used for planning and analyses purposes only and are not legally binding with
                regard to title or location of National Forest System lands.
