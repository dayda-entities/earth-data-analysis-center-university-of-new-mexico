The 2006 Second Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The 2006 Second Edition  TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  

This shapefile represents landmark layer stored in the 2006 TIGER Second Edition dataset for Colfax County, NM.
