 This data has been collected by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in New Mexico at
the New Mexico State Office. The initial data source is the statewide Public Land Survey System
(PLSS) coverage for the state of New Mexico, generated at the BLM New Mexico State Office.
Additional data was onscreen-digitized from BLM Cadastral Survey Plats and Master Title Plats, or
tablet-digitized from 1:24,000 paper maps. This revision reflects boundary adjustments made in the
Albuquerque area to more accurately reflect boundaries as depicted on USGS 1:24,000 topographic
maps. Note for Shapefiles: Shapefiles have been created from coverages using the "Export Coverage to
Shapefile" function in ArcGIS 8.3. All occurrences of "#" and "-" in INFO item names are replaced
with an underscore character. This includes COVER# and COVER-ID, which become "COVER_" and
"COVER_ID". Additionally, the Shapefile format only allows 10 characters in item names, so long item
names are truncated. To avoid duplicate names, the items are truncated and assigned consecutive
numbers. For example, in a coverage called CITY_STREET the items "CITY_STREET#" and "CITY_STREET-ID"
become "CITY_STRE" and "CITY_STR_1" .
