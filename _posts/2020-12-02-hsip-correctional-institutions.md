 Jails and Prisons (Correctional Institutions). The Jails and Prisons
                sub-layer is part of the Emergency Law Enforcement Sector and the Critical
                Infrastructure Category. A Jail or Prison consists of any facility or location where
                individuals are regularly and lawfully detained against their will. This includes
                Federal and State prisons, local jails, and juvenile detention facilities, as well
                as law enforcement temporary holding facilities. Work camps, including camps
                operated seasonally, are included if they otherwise meet the definition. A Federal
                Prison is a facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for the incarceration
                of individuals. A State Prison is a facility operated by a state, commonwealth, or
                territory of the US for the incarceration of individuals for a term usually longer
                than 1 year. A Juvenile Detention Facility is a facility for the incarceration of
                those who have not yet reached the age of majority (usually 18 years). A Local Jail
                is a locally administered facility that holds inmates beyond arraignment (usually 72
                hours) and is staffed by municipal or county employees. A temporary holding
                facility, sometimes referred to as a "police lock up" or "drunk tank", is a facility
                used to detain people prior to arraignment. Locations that are administrative
                offices only are excluded from the dataset. This definition of Jails is consistent
                with that used by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in their "National Jail Census",
                with the exception of "temporary holding facilities", which the DOJ excludes.
                Locations which function primarily as law enforcement offices are included in this
                dataset if they have holding cells. If the facility is enclosed with a fence, wall,
                or structure with a gate around the buildings only, the locations were depicted as
                "on entity" at the center of the facility. If the facility's buildings are not
                enclosed, the locations were depicted as "on entity" on the main building or "block
                face" on the correct street segment. Personal homes, administrative offices, and
                temporary locations are intended to be excluded from this dataset. TGS has made a
                concerted effort to include all correctional institutions. This dataset includes non
                license restricted data from the following federal agencies: Bureau of Indian
                Affairs; Bureau of Reclamation; U.S. Park Police; Federal Bureau of Prisons; Bureau
                of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; U.S. Marshals Service; U.S. Fish and
                Wildlife Service; National Park Service; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement;
                and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This dataset is comprised completely of
                license free data. The Law Enforcement dataset and the Correctional Institutions
                dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then
                separated for delivery purposes. With the merge of the Law Enforcement and the
                Correctional Institutions datasets, NAICS Codes & Descriptions were assigned
                based on the facility's main function which was determined by the entity's name,
                facility type, web research, and state supplied data. In instances where the
                entity's primary function is both law enforcement and corrections, the NAICS Codes
                and Descriptions are assigned based on the dataset in which the record is located
                (i.e., a facility that serves as both a Sheriff's Office and as a jail is designated
                as [NAICSDESCR]="SHERIFFS' OFFICES (EXCEPT COURT FUNCTIONS ONLY)" in the Law
                Enforcement layer and as [NAICSDESCR]="JAILS (EXCEPT PRIVATE OPERATION OF)" in the
                Correctional Institutions layer). Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the
                [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation
                Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range
                boundaries. "#" and "*" characters were automatically removed from standard fields
                that TGS populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same
                fields. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate
                consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut
                or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English
                character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.
                The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based on the
                values in this field, the oldest record dates from 12/27/2004 and the newest record
                dates from 09/08/2009
