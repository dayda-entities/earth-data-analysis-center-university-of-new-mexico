 This layer represents boundaries for New Mexico's gross receipts tax districts as
identified on the "Gross Receipts Tax Rate Schedule" published by the Taxation and Revenue
Department. Initial municipal boundaries acquired from RGIS and based on layers developed by the
Earth Data Analysis Center (EDAC) at UNM. TRD revisions have been made by acquiring updated
boundaries from data stewards at local jurisdictions. Data is a vector polygon digital data
structure taken from the Census Bureau's TIGER/Line Files, 1994, for New Mexico Known issues: This
data layer may contain unintended inaccuracies and omissions. It is meant to serve as a baseline
representation from which to make additions and improvements.
