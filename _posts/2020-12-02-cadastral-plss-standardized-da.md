 This feature class is part of the Cadastral National Spatial Data
                Infrastructure (NSDI) CADNSDI publication data set for rectangular and
                non-rectangular Public Land Survey System (PLSS) data set. The metadata description
                in the Cadastral Reference System Feature Data Set more fully describes the entire
                data set. The PLSS Reference Grid is a generalized data set providing the Township
                and First Divisions of the PLSS as a separate feature class to support data
                requests, mapping and indexing. The spatial location and position and attributes of
                this feature class are the same as those in the primary data sets from which this
                data is built. These data are often used for map sheet layouts and general location
                reference
