 This feature class is part of the Cadastral National Spatial Data
                Infrastructure (NSDI) CADNSDI publication data set for rectangular and
                non-rectangular Public Land Survey System (PLSS) data set. The metadata description
                in the Cadastral Reference System Feature Data Set more fully describes the entire
                data set. The PLSS First Division is commonly the section but can also be lots or
                tracts. This ifeature class s the first set of divisions for a PLSS Township. If the
                first division is a section the nominal size is one mile on a side and 640 acres,
                but actual sections will vary.
