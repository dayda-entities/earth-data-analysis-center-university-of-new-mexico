 This feature class is part of the Cadastral National Spatial Data
                Infrastructure (NSDI) CADNSDI publication data set for rectangular and
                non-rectangular Public Land Survey System (PLSS) data set. The metadata description
                in the Cadastral Reference System Feature Data Set more fully describes the entire
                data set. This feature class contains the Special Surveys which are non-rectangular
                components of the PLSS from BLM survey records. These special survey areas are
                generated from combinations of special survey codes, designators, notes and suffix
                information in the PLSS Intersected feature class.
