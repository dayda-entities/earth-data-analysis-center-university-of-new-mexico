 This feature class is part of the Cadastral National Spatial Data
                Infrastructure (NSDI) CADNSDI publication data set for rectangular and
                non-rectangular Public Land Survey System (PLSS) data set. The metadata description
                in the Cadastral Reference System Feature Data Set more fully describes the entire
                data set. The fully intersected data is the atomic level of the PLSS that is similar
                to the Esri coverage or the smallest pieces used to build the PLSS. Polygons may
                overlap in this feature class. This feature class will also contain retired or
                replaced areas of the PLSS.
