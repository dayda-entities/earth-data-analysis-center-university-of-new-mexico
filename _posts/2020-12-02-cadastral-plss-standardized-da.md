 This feature class is part of the Cadastral National Spatial Data
                Infrastructure (NSDI) CADNSDI publication data set for rectangular and
                non-rectangular Public Land Survey System (PLSS) data set. The metadata description
                in the Cadastral Reference System Feature Data Set more fully describes the entire
                data set. This feature class contains the Public Land Survey System Townships which
                are the primary unit of survey for the PLSS, nominally six miles on a side, usually
                containing 36 sections. PLSS Townships are numbered from base lines and principal
                meridians.
