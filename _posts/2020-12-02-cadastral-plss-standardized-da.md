 This feature class is part of the Cadastral National Spatial Data
                Infrastructure (NSDI) CADNSDI publication data set for rectangular and
                non-rectangular Public Land Survey System (PLSS) data set. The metadata description
                in the Cadastral Reference System Feature Data Set more fully describes the entire
                data set. This feature class is the second division of the PLSS is quarter,
                quarter-quarter, sixteenth or government lot divisions of the PLSS. The second and
                third divisions are combined into this feature class as an intentional
                de-normalization of the PLSS hierarchical data. The polygons in this feature class
                represent the smallest division to the sixteenth that has been defined for the first
                division. For example In some cases sections have only been divided to the quarter.
                Divisions below the sixteenth are in the Special Survey or Parcel Feature Class.
