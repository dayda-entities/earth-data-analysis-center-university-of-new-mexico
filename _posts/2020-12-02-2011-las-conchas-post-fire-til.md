 This data set consists of an orthophotography tile index based on
                multi-spectral (red, green, blue, near-infrared) digital aerial imagery, collected
                and processed by Wilson and Company, of the Las Conchas Fire that burned in the
                Santa Fe National Forest in the Jemez Mountains of central New Mexico in the summer
                of 2011. The Area of Interest (AOI) is 632,000 acres and is larger than the actual
                burn acreage of approximately 150,000 acres that lies within the AOI. Aerial imagery
                was collected with a frame - based Z/I Digital Mapping Camera at an average
                elevation of 4,500 feet above ground; generating an average ground sample distance
                (gsd) of 0.45 feet. The imagery will support the Forest Service Burned Area
                Emergency Response (BAER) program that addresses landscape damage due to the fire,
                with the goal of protecting life, property, water quality, and deteriorated
                ecosystems from further damage now that the fire is out. Mosaicked digital
                orthorectified quarter-quarter quadrangles (DOQQQs) for the project area were
                produced. The DOQQQs cover the entire image area of one quarter of a USGS standard
                quarter quadrant, with a 260 meter buffer on all four sides.
