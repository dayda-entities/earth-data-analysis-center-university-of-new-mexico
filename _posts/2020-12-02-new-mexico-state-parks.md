This dataset provides an initial version of the generalized physical boundaries of New
Mexico State Parks, in polygonal form with limited attributes, compiled using available data from a
variety of sources. The boundaries have been digitized from AutoCAD drawings and/or from legal
descriptions, supplemented by digital orthophotography cross-checking, and adjusted to the GCDB when
possible. The dataset will be refined in the future to include other attributes and provide better
accuracy.
