The TIGER/Line Shapefiles are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic
information from the Census MAF/TIGER database. The Census MAF/TIGER database represents a seamless
national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each TIGER/Line Shapefile is designed
to stand alone as an independent data set or the shapefiles can be combined to cover the whole
nation.
