The geologic map was created in GSMAP at Socorro, New Mexico by Orin Anderson and Glen Jones and published as the Geologic Map of New Mexico 1:500,000 in GSMAP format in 1994. This graphic file was converted to ARC/INFO format by Greb Green and GlenJones and released as the Geologic Map of New Mexico in ARC/INFO format in 1997. This shapefile only shows the volcanic vents for New Mexico, that are used on the Digital Geologic Map for New Mexico.
