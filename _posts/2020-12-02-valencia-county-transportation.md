The TIGER/Line Shapefiles are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census MAF/TIGER database.  The Census MAF/TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each TIGER/Line Shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the shapefiles can be combined to cover the whole nation.
