 Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) in New Mexico "The physical location at
				which the coordination of information and resources to support domestic incident
				management activities normally takes place. An EOC may be a temporary facility or
				may be located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a
				higher level of organization within a jurisdiction. EOCs may be organized by major
				functional disciplines (e.g., fire, law enforcement, and medical services), by
				jurisdiction (e.g., Federal, State, regional, county, city, tribal), or some
				combination thereof." (Excerpted from the National Incident Management System) In
				instances where TGS could not verify the location of an Emergency Operations Center
				due to non-cooperation of the entity and to the exhaustion of all possible
				alternative resources, its location was depicted at the center of the service area.
				In cases where an Emergency Operations Center has a mobile unit, TGS captured the
				location of the mobile unit as a separate record. This record represents where the
				mobile unit is stored. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case
				to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the
				German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent
				English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support
				diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE]
				attribute. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record dates from 03/28/2007 and
				the newest record dates from 04/25/2007.
