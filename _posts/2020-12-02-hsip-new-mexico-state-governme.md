 This dataset includes buildings occupied by the headquarters of cabinet level
                state government executive departments, legislative offices buildings outside of the
                capitol building, offices and court rooms associated with the highest level of the
                judicial branch of the state government, and large multi-agency state office
                buildings. Because the research to create this data was primarily keyed off of the
                headquarters of cabinet level state government agencies, some state office buildings
                that don't house a headquarters for such an agency may have been excluded.
                Intentionally excluded from this dataset are government run institutions (e.g.
                schools, colleges, prisons, and libraries). Also excluded are state capitol
                buildings. State owned or leased buildings whose primary purpose is not to house
                state offices have also been intentionally excluded from this dataset. Examples of
                these include "Salt Domes", "Park Shelters", and "Highway Garages". All entities
                that have been verified to have no building name, have had their [NAME] attribute
                set to "NO NAME". If the record in the original source data had no building name and
                TGS was unable to verify the building name, the [NAME] attribute was set to
                "UNKNOWN". All phone numbers in this dataset have been verified by TGS to be the
                main phone for the building. If the building was verified not to have a main phone
                number, the [AREA] and [PHONE] fields have been left blank. All entities located on
                military bases have been removed from this dataset. The text fields in this dataset
                have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search
                results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been
                replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with
                database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is
                indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record
                dates from 2007/12/03 and the newest record dates from 2007/12/06.
