The TIGER/Line Shapefiles are an extract of selected geographic and
				cartographic information from the Census MAF/TIGER database. The Census MAF/TIGER
				database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts.
				However, each TIGER/Line Shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data
				set or the shapefiles can be combined to cover the whole nation.
