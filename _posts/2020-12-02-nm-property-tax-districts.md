 This layer represents boundaries for New Mexico tax district "OUT" categories and
incorporated/municipal "IN" categories as identified on the "Certificate of Tax Rates" published for
each of the State's thirty-three counties by the Department of Finance and Administration's Budget
and Finance Bureau. Initial municipal boundaries acquired from RGIS and based on layers developed by
the Earth Data Analysis Center (EDAC) at UNM. TRD revisions have been made by acquiring updated
boundaries from data stewards at local jurisdictions. Data is a vector polygon digital data
structure taken from the Census Bureau's TIGER/Line Files, 1994, for New Mexico. Known issues: This
data layer may contain unintended inaccuracies and omissions. It is meant to serve as a baseline
representation from which to make additions and improvements.
