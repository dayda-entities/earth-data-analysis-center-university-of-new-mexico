This dataset contains the New Mexico Senate District Boundaries as of July 2006. It is in
a vector digital shapefile created to show the voting precinct coverage for New Mexico and the scale
is unknown. The source software was shapefile provided by the Office of the NM Secretary of State.
The precinct map was obtained from the NM Secretary of State's office as a composite of the voting
precincts and the house and senate legislative boundaries. The precinct map was dissolved on the
senate attribute to make this shapefile.
