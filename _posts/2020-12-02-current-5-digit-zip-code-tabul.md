The 2006 Second Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The 2006 Second Edition  TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  

This shapefile represents the current 5-Digit Zip Code Tabulation Areas for Hidalgo County stored in the 2006 TIGER Second Edition dataset.
